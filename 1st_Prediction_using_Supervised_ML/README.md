    I have done the project in 4 steps:

      1- Import libraries and data set
      2- EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
      3- Split data set (train, test)
      4- Train & Test model (Linear Regression)

Note: Level of this task (Beginner), but during the training, we will work on tasks of (intermediate and advanced) levels.
