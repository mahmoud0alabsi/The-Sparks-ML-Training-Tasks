<h2>3rd Task - Decision Tree calssifier</h2>

<p>The 3rd task in the sparks foundation internship in (data science) field is Classification using Decision Tree, we have to train a model to classify the types of iris depend on 4 features.
  </p>
  
  
  <p>
    I have done the project in 4 steps:

      1- Import libraries and data set
      2- EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
      3- Split data set (train, test)
      4- Features Engineering (Scalling)
      5- Train Decision Tree model
      6- Test model and get results
      7- Plot Decision Tree Classifier

The data is (iris) from datasets in sklearn library.
