The 2nd task in the sparks foundation internship in (data science) field is Prediction using Unsupervised ML, we have to train a model to predict (Iris) species without using their labels.

I have done the project in 4 steps:

  1- Import libraries and data set
  2- EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
  3- Split data set (x, y) **There is no test set
  4- Train & plot results
Note: Level of this task (Beginner), but during the training, we will work on tasks of (intermediate and advanced) levels.
